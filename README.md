# Text-Mining
Project files for the Text Mining course 2017 at VU Amsterdam. Song lyrics of 380.000+ songs has been scraped and used for sentiment analysis and geolocation visualisation. Natural Language Processing tools such as tokenization, Named Entity Recognition and sentiment analysis has been used.

Three Python code files are added in this project directory.
1. 'Compare_artists.py' lets you compare the overall sentiment of two different artists.
2. 'Wordclouds.py' outputs two wordclouds after entering an artist's name. The wordclouds visualises the most frequent words in the 15 most positive and negative songs.
3. 'Timeline.py' gives a visualisation of a the sentiment of songs of a requested artist through the years. The sentiment per song is presented, and a line is shown for the average sentiment per year.
